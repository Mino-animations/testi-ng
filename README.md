# Introduction

Hello there. I am a prospective 2D animator who has always loved the art of motion and combat. These things have always fascinated me a great deal. Giving life to art 1 day at a time.


## A duel

In this piece I used animation to detail a duel between two charactersâ€”an evolution from what originally inspired me to this media.

### Pogo stick

This piece focuses on the basics of weight and motion having the character using a pogo stick.


### A play into Fantasy 
This piece draws from my love of the fantastical or medieval aesthetic. Having drawn this a few years ago. But I enjoyed the creation of such a peice.
